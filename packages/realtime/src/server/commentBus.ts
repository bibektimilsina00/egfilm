 * Tiny bridge so app-router route handlers can broadcast comment events to
 * Socket.IO clients without importing the full socket server (or socket.io).
 *
 * The Socket.IO server (pages/api/socketio) and the app-router routes are
 * bundled separately by Next, so a plain module-level singleton would NOT be
 * shared between them. We stash the emitter on `globalThis`, which is shared
 * across all bundles in the same Node process.
